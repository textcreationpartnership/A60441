         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>who art the moſt delightſom Plant, of moſt Honourable Renown; renowned with honourable Dignity for ever; the Delight of all the Upright, the Life of all the Vertuous, the Spouſe of all the Unwedded Undefiled Virgins; the Staff of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Strength, the Bread of <hi>Jacobs</hi> Soul, the Succour of <hi>Joſeph</hi> in time of need, the Mouth of <hi>Moſes</hi> Wiſdom, the Rock of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Strength, the certain Hiding-place of all the Troubled, the Houſe of all the former ſcattered, the Bed of Repoſe wherein the beautified Damſels fill themſelves with the ſolace of moſt heavenly divine Delights, whoſe Beauty ſurpaſſeth expreſſions of words, whoſe tender Offers have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited many, whoſe Love hath allured the hearts of thouſands, whoſe pleaſant Countenance hath prevailed with a numberleſs number to love thee for ever; whoſe pleaſant Smiles have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered unto thee innumerable Doves of the Wilderneſs, and thy Vertue hath cauſed the barren deſolate to bring forth both Bud, Bloſſom and Fruit in abundance; the Breath of thy No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils hath enlivened the Dead, the ſound of thy Voice hath quickened the Weary, and by thy Power hath the Barren brought forth in abundance, whereby the Earth hath been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with thy fruitful Riches; Thou art cloathed with Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105212:2"/> for ever, Thy dwelling is hid from all the diſobedient children of men, Thou haſt bound thy ſelf (to live out of their ſight) with thy Darlings in a ſtronger Covenant than all Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; Thou deckeſt thy Beloved for thy ſelf, and then thou delighteſt in her; Thou prepareſt thy Spouſe for the joy of thy heart, and then loveſt her becauſe of her beauty; Thou deckeſt her with Ornaments of well-refined Gold, and cauſeſt her face to ſhine; Thou filleſt her with Glory within, and cauſeſt her to dwell among the Honourable, and walk with the choiceſt Virgins in the Paths of great delight, and ſhe is become the Daughter of the King of kings; Thy Goodneſs doth much overcome the hearts of many, thy Wiſdom pleaſeth the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; thy Meekneſs delighteth hundreds, thy Strength up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth an infinit number, and thy Life nouriſheth thouſands; thou reneweſt the ſtrength of the Faint, thou turneſt the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death into a Morning, thou keepeſt thy Flock under the ſhadow of thy Wing, and nouriſheſt them with the choiceſt Food; thou guideſt them with the hand of thy Power, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coureſt them at every needful time, and thou relieveſt their greateſt wants: the conſideration of thee (which brings thy Goodneſs into remembrance) even filleth the hearts of the Flock of thy Fold, and thou art He who only ſatisfieth them for ever.</p>
            <p>Oh! where waſt thou in the day of Adverſity, and where was thy dwelling in the time of the Night? Where didſt thou hide thy ſelf in the day of Tranſgreſſion, and to what place didſt thou confine thy ſelf when Iniquity ruled? and what was thy ſtate in the time of man's Sin? Ah! how waſt thou then as a ſlain Lamb, and as a meek Prince deprived of his Kingdom and Government? how waſt thou, as a true Heir deprived of his Right, and as an only Son from the Father's Houſe, and found not wherein to reſt thy head? How waſt thou grieved in that day, and how waſt thou wounded by thy pretended friends? how was thy Glory defamed, and thy Honour laid aſide? how was thy Beauty marred, and thy Wiſdom bound up as in an obſcure place? how did Darkneſs compaſs about thy dwelling? how was thy Strength put by, and thy Comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as if it had not been? Waſt thou not as in a Grave in the midſt of all the wicked? and waſt not thou taken in their pits,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105212:2" rendition="simple:additions"/> and lay long ſlain in the ſtreets of the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and exiled as the greateſt Captives.</p>
            <p>Oh! where didſt thou hide thy ſelf when the Dragon caſt forth his flood, when the Waves ſwelled, and when the Land was fruitleſs, when the Birth failed in the Womb, when the Seed came not to maturity; when the Blade was killed in the Spring, when the ſharp nipping Froſt cut down the head of the tender Herb; when the Winter nights were long, when the boiſtrous Storms were many; when the whole Earth was covered with thick darkneſs, when the Heavens were as Braſs; when the Rain deſcended not, when the diſtilling Dews came not down; when the Bloſſom withered in the time of drouth, when the Path to dwell in was not known; when the Stars ſhone not, when all the Lights of Heaven were eclipſed; when the Voice of the Shepherd was not known, when the Eye of the Travellor was dim; when none could direct him in his Way, nor ſupply him with Food for his Journey, nor Water in his greateſt thirſt, nor ſuccour him in the time of the Storm, when he knew not the end of his Journey, neither perceived the way to go, nor ever could have reſt till he came there; when the feet of the Virgin ſtuck in the mire, and the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man failed of ſtrength; when no way was known but a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, when no ſuccour was found but a Forreſt of moſt fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful devouring Beaſts; when the Scorpians did bite in the day-time, when the Lion did roar in the night; when the Dragon was near to devour, when the Wolf yelled for his Prey; when the Foxes ſpoiled the tender Grapes, when the brazen Serpent could not be ſeen; when thy Lambs cryed as in the day of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs, when the Young lamented the birth for want of the food; when thy Damſels fainted with thirſt, when pity was not to be found amongſt men; when Mercy could not be ſeen in Heaven, neither would the Earth open her mouth and ſwallow up to end the ſtate of Miſery; when this day of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble was as in a Whirlwind, or as a combuſtious Thunder in the midſt of heat and cold, which none doth know but the man that hath ſeen it; who in the bitterneſs of his ſoul hath long travelled as a Woman in her ſore pangs of Sorrow, through the Warfare, in the grievous troubleſome day of diſtreſs?</p>
            <p>Oh! how waſt thou then as a Priſoner in the Pit, and where
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105212:3"/> was thy place to be found, or who could ſearch out thy dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? O Thou! <hi>now, well known to be, the much more than the threefold, Chiefeſt of ten thouſand hundred thouſand, and of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of thouſands!</hi> to whom my ſoul's love can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>Ariſe now thou Meek One of Wiſdom, ſpeak forth thy ſelf in thy own Virtue; let thy Spouſe hear thy Voice and rejoyce in thee for evermore, whom thou haſt fitted for thy ſelf, a chaſt comely Virgin, to ſhine forth thy Glory in for ever: for thy Beauty hath often filled my heart with precious Oyl, and the Deſire of Thee hath drawn me out of my ſelf; my lips at firſt have ſtammered at thy preſence, but thou haſt healed the wounded heart: Thou art the chiefeſt of all Delights, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are all them that know thee.</p>

               <p>Ariſe out of the duſt, awake as in the days of old; let thine Eye be more bright with the Light of the Day than in the Ages paſt; adorn thy ſelf with Comlineſs, deck thee with Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prepare thee with ſweet Oyntments; put on Beauty as a Beam of the Morning, ſhine forth as the fairneſs of the Sun; enrobe thee with Righteouſneſs as with a Garment, and deck thy ſelf with precious Jewels as the choiceſt Bride; grow up as the tender Plant, ſpring forth as the Lilly; bloſſom as the Roſe, be fruitful as the Vine; grow up as the Cedar, ſpread as the Vine-branches; let Salvation be the Wall on which thou layeſt hold, come forth as the increaſing Herbs of the field, with many ſtems from one root, and many branches on every ſtem, and many bloſſoms on every branch, and (much more) many ſeeds of fruitful increaſe under or after every bloſſom, that the Sower may be made glad with the abundance of the increaſe thereof; that the good Husbandman may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his labour, that the Planter may delight in the works of his hands.</p>

               <p>And that man which truly Suffered with it, Reigns with it, who was joyned to it in its Suffering, till it come to Reign, and then to ſubmit unto it and ſerve it, in its Motions, Leadings, Rulings, and Governings, in the power of its Love, which winneth the heart ſo to do, as the chaſte wife to the husband, ſo with it, in the power of it, man comes to Reign over that which was both contrary to it, and to the upright hearted man, until all its enemies are put under it, and ſo under the man that is one with it, and whoſe Life is in it, being truly joyned to it of the Lord, (then not to be put aſunder) and ſo loving of it, and in all things ſubmitting to it, more than the true chaſte Virgin to the Husband, living in the power, and the power living in man, and ſo both becoming one in Sufferings, one in Trials, one in Tribulations, one in Afflictions, one in Joy, one in Peace, one in Liberty, one in Captivity, one in Riches, one in Poverty: And ſo truly one, partaking with each other, in all ſtates unſeparable, may well in ſome meaſure be termed, <hi>The Marriage of the Lamb which is come,</hi> (and more of it may be known) and the Virgin being thus and more fully eſpouſed, to the undefiled, unſpotted of God, they are thus far made one, and ſhe becomes the Daughter of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Father, the King of kings, or the Adopted Child of God.</p>
               <p>And thus the vndefiled One of God and the Virgin of <hi>Sion,</hi> becomes one in the unſpeakable Unity, which Unity being
